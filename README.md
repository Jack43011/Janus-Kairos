# Janus-Kairos
A novel AGI architecture for dynamic alignment. Janus-Kairos uses a dual-kernel (executive/judicial) system for resilient self-correction and a meta-cognitive validation loop to create provably safe, anti-fragile intelligence. This framework moves beyond the limitations of brittle, static rule-sets.
